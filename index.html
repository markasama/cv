        My name is Mark, I'm originally from NY, NY and spent a lot of my time growing up online learning
        cool things, playing a few video games, and socializing with others over the web.

        During college I spent time learning about Business and how computers and their underlying programs and
        algorithms work to create the world around us, and fell in love with learning as much as I could about it.
        I started getting more involved with information technology in my junior year, and I led the business-side
        of the awesome data science project team on campus: <a href="https://cornelldata.science/">Cornell Data Science</a>.
        <br /><br />

        I began working at Qualtrics in 2019 as a Product Specialist and later taught myself enough programming
        to contribute to our Engineering department. I'm now a support engineer working on alerting that enables
        users to understand if and when their <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/">experience management (XM)</a>
        projects are not working as expected,so that users can collect meaningful data without interruptions or
        user-caused mistakes.<br /><br />

        Some of the most interesting projects I've helped include solutions set up for distributing Covid-19 tests,
        for tracing social contacts for when an individual tests positive for Covid-19, and customer experience
        projects for dozens of Fortune 500 companies (including Sirius XM, Southwest Airlines, and AAA).<br />
